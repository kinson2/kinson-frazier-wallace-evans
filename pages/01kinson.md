King David Kinson was born circa 1872 in the town of Rowell, Marion County, South Carolina. According to US Census records, in Marion County, the black population (53%) outnumbered the white population (46%) by 1880. By 1920, he moved to Georgia, specifically, Militia District 900, Baker County and worked for wages as a laborer in the turpentine industry. He was married to Rosa Frazier and both could read and write. During this time, Rosa's mother, Malinda Alfred, a Mississippi native, lived with them. By 1930, King and Rosa had two children, King David Kinson II (10 years old) and Milton (7 years old) and still lived in Baker County, but now in Militia District 971.
