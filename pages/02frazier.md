# Rosa Frazier

Rosa Frazier (sometimes written as Rosalie, Rosey or Rosie) was born in circa 1894 probably in Georgia, but she had roots in Mississippi. By 1920, she was married to King David Kinson and living with him and her mother, Malinda Alfred, who was a widow. Rosa had her first child, King David Kinson II, around age 26. Rosa could read and write at a relatively young age.
