# Jeff Wallace Sr.

Jeff Wallace was born circa 1891 most likely in Dougherty County, Georgia to Henry and Tilla Wallace. In 1900, he was attending school in Dougherty County. In 1910, he lived with his Aunt Rachel Starks and Uncle Isreal Starks in Baker County and worked on a farm. At around age 25, he married Charity Evans and they conceived their first child Luella Wallace. By 1920, the family included two more kids, Jesse Lee (a toddler) and Beatrice (an infant). He rented and worked on the farm he was renting. Historically, this was known as sharecropping. 10 years later in 1930, the Wallace family expaned to a total of 7 children - Luella (age 13), Jesse Lee (age 12), Beatrice (age 11), Ada (age 9), Misouri (age 4), Liza (age 3), and Jeff Jr (age 1). Some time between 1930 and 1940, Jeff died leaving behind his wife Charity and several children including later additions: Henry, Major, Atlas, and Eva Mae, as well as pre-deceased by Mamie Wallace, who died in her infancy.
